  <dt class="highlighted">How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible">Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes).

  <li>Grand Canyon didn’t become a national park until 1919. Although the Grand Canyon may seem like an obvious choice for a national park, the first attempt to organize Grand Canyon as a national park was made in 1882, and it was shot down. In fact, the canyon didn’t become a national monument until 1908, and then it took 11 more years to finally establish it as a national park. The reason for the delay? Land and mining moguls who were concerned that the classification would restrict their access to the area.</li>
